                     # Steps for successful simulation

=> Step 1: open LM35-PIC16F877A-LEDs-MOTOR-PUSH-BUTTONS proteus project
=> Step 2: double click on the PIC16F877A Microcontroller, 
           go to the program file row and click the folder icon
=> Step 3: find and click on LM35-PIC16F877A-LEDs-MOTOR-PUSH-BUTTONS.production.hex inside the hex file folder
=> Step 4: Finally its done! you may now run the simulation!

                     # Project description
